# Listicle
Made using HTML/CSS Pages, a listicle is a somewhat of a trendy type of article that uses a list as its thematic structure
I have created a listicle web page that describes the “4 on-campus beverages you should
be drinking” at your campus.
The web page is created in listicle.html with styles defined in listicle-style.css.
